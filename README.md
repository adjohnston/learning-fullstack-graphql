# Learning Fullstack Graphql

Getting an understanding of how to create a server &amp; client side using graphql.

## The Stack

### Backend

* Apollo Server
* Serverless
* AWS Lambda
* DynamoDB

I plan to add Dynaogels later as DynamoDB is a pain to handle and I want to add support for offline/local development.

### Frontend

* Apollo Client
* Create React App (there's an issue with Apollo Link which caused me to use it)
* Zeit Now.
